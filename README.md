The COVID-19 pandemic observed a major upsurge
in the adoption of virtual service mechanisms by
multifarious offline businesses, especially restaurants
and other food outlets. As a consequence, customers
writing reviews during this period were left to judge
restaurants solely based on their online experience.
We suspect this to have significantly altered review
dynamics with the increased reliance of a user on
their community for making decisions online. 

In this observational study, we implement three distinct
methodologies in an attempt to quantify the degree of
community influence during the pandemic. We compare
our findings with prior works in the field to draw
inferences about the significance of a userâ€™s community
on online review platforms. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of a shift in the influence of the community
on user reviews, indicating that users writing
reviews on an online experience write them based on
their own experiences rather than their community.
